To run the tests:

Use Maven command 'mvn test'
If you do not have maven installed these tests can be run in intellij or eclipse using the testng plugin.  The tests
must be run using a testng suite file (filename.xml).
There is a maven pom profile in the project which is by default set to use the testng suite file called prod.xml
This file is located in the src/test/java/resources folder.

These tests can be parallelized across 'tests' as defined in the suite file.  Each test should contain one and only
one class file if you are running in parallel.  Reason for this is we have class inheritance and trying to run tests in
parallel by class will result in test failures.  Running with one thread per class file will yield about a 48%
improvement in execution time with most of the time being spent in dimmer commands tests due to the syncronous nature of
those tests.

This automation will run against any controller and project (with minor setup).  You will need to create a new testNG
suite file found under the resources folder with parameters for your controller.

Command tests will detect drivers in your project which are identified and use them to run the command tests.
If there are no identified drivers in your project for switches, configurable keypads, fan speed controllers, or dimmers
of all types then warnings will be logged and no tests will be run against the driver commands.
